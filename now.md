# Now

*This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). It's what I'd tell a friend I hadn't seen in a year.*

**Last updated:** January 2026

## Music

I'm on a music arc at the minute. I tend to cycle through interests a couple of times a year - meditation, theology, literature, visual arts, music - but it's cyclical and quite intense, and right now I'm deep in music.

Teaching myself piano again. Learning by rote, mostly - just repeating pieces until the hard bits become natural, then picking up another when I get bored. Currently working through the Outset Island theme from Zelda: The Wind Waker, quite slowly. A lot of video game nostalgia from the early 2000s. Also Eric Satie - Gymnopédie No. 1 and that sort of thing.

Playing entirely for pleasure. It's been kind of life-changing. The kids are really enjoying it with me.

## BJJ

Brown belt. Trying to patch gaps in my leg locks game this year. Luckily I have good training partners and friends at my current gym.

## Family

Insanely busy with young kids. Enjoying family life, but there isn't really time for DIY or the sorts of things that kept me out of trouble before.

## Stable interests

AI and technology are probably the exception - a stable interest where I'm curious year-round, particularly around AI and software. Hence this blog.
