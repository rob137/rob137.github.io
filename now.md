# Now

*This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). It's what I'd tell a friend I hadn't seen in a year.*

**Last updated:** February 2026

## Family

Insanely busy with young kids. Enjoying family life, but there isn't really time for DIY or the sorts of things that kept me out of trouble before. The one exception is AI and technology - curious about that year-round. Hence this blog.

## Talking to Machines

Experimenting with field recorders, lav mics, cardioid microphones, various phone applications - basically trying to reduce the friction in talking to LLMs to zero using speech-to-text. This is more or less entirely for work. It's different from tinkering with your Claude Code setup or whatever - it's about [decreasing friction when talking to models](/2026/01/27/workflows-without-names/). There's an extreme positive feedback loop here: improving the workflow makes you want to improve it more, because the progress you make as a result of unlocking the models is really pronounced. Most of the open questions for me are still around form factor, transcription quality, and ensuring it's effortless to interact with a model when forming ideas or working through problems.

## Music

Taking piano lessons again. Concentrating on scales, broken chords, and theory - things I totally neglected growing up.

Recently managed to get the contact details for my childhood piano teacher, who's now in her late 80s and in care. I was nervous ringing her, but we ended up talking for half an hour. She'd spent her life teaching, came from a musical family, loved it. She was delighted I'd thought to reach out, and excited that I was learning again. A really lovely experience.

As a kid, I resented piano lessons. I thought they were waypoints towards grade exams I didn't enjoy. The pressure was partly the framing of lessons, partly self-imposed. Now I'm treating piano as a meditative activity rather than an achievement thing. Repeating scales and drills and pieces to get better for the sake of getting better - a way of spending time well rather than something that leads anywhere.

Looking at small MIDI controllers for my desk. Something I can mix into the day as a kind of mindless fidget-spinner activity between tasks.

Also tiptoeing towards field recording. Getting ambient sound for podcast episodes appeals to me in a way I can't fully explain. Holding an H2 Essential with a dead cat over a local stream is exactly the kind of thing I would love to do - and exactly the kind of thing Gemma would call a stop to. Falling into the trouser-suspender vortex. Not sure I can stop at this stage of the obsession cycle.

## BJJ

Enjoying working with people at my gym who are preparing for competition. I'm too busy with work and family to compete myself at the moment, but I'm hoping to get back to it when things settle down. In the meantime, it's really fun helping people prep.
