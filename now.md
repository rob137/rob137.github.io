# Now

*This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). It's what I'd tell a friend I hadn't seen in a year.*

## Music

I'm on a music arc at the minute. I tend to cycle through interests a couple of times a year - meditation, theology, literature, visual arts, music - but it's cyclical and quite intense, and right now I'm deep in music.

Teaching myself piano again. Learning by rote, mostly - just repeating pieces until the hard bits become natural, then picking up another when I get bored. Recently been learning [Outset Island](https://www.ninsheetmusic.org/download/pdf/3900) from Zelda: The Wind Waker, which my family are pretty sick of listening to. Trying to figure out what to learn next - probably something else from video game nostalgia. Koji Kondo pieces tend not to get boring, which is turning out to be a superpower for learning since I can play things again and again until they click.

Playing entirely for pleasure. It's been kind of life-changing. My eldest daughter is learning piano at the moment, so we're learning together to some degree - I figured it would help to show an interest as she's getting started herself. The kids are really enjoying it.

## BJJ

Enjoying working with people at my gym who are preparing for competition. I'm too busy with work and family to compete myself at the moment, but I'm hoping to get back to it when things settle down. In the meantime, it's really fun helping people prep.

## Family

Insanely busy with young kids. Enjoying family life, but there isn't really time for DIY or the sorts of things that kept me out of trouble before. The one exception is AI and technology - curious about that year-round. Hence this blog.
