# Now

*This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). It's what I'd tell a friend I hadn't seen in a year.*

**Last updated:** January 2026

## Music

I'm on a music arc at the minute. I tend to cycle through interests a couple of times a year - meditation, theology, literature, visual arts, music - but it's cyclical and quite intense, and right now I'm deep in music.

Teaching myself piano again. Learning by rote, mostly - just repeating pieces until the hard bits become natural, then picking up another when I get bored. Currently working through the Outset Island theme from Zelda: The Wind Waker, quite slowly. A lot of video game nostalgia from the early 2000s. Also Eric Satie - Gymnopédie No. 1 and that sort of thing.

Playing entirely for pleasure. It's been kind of life-changing. My eldest daughter is learning piano at the moment, so we're learning together to some degree - I figured it would help to show an interest as she's getting started herself. The kids are really enjoying it.

## BJJ

Brown belt. Trying to patch gaps in my leg locks game this year. Luckily I have good friends and training partners at my current and previous gyms.

## Family

Insanely busy with young kids. Enjoying family life, but there isn't really time for DIY or the sorts of things that kept me out of trouble before. The one exception is AI and technology - curious about that year-round. Hence this blog.
