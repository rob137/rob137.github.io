# About

I'm Rob Kirby. I write software for a living, but I came to it sideways.

Before code, I was an intelligence corps officer in the British Army - a job that turned out to be mostly about synthesising too much information into something actionable. Before that, I studied philosophy, which turned out to be mostly about figuring out what questions are actually being asked.

These days I work at a portfolio software company, thinking about how AI and large language models are reshaping the way we build things. This blog is where I write about what I'm noticing.

I'm also a father of three, which means most of my experiments happen in the margins of domestic chaos. I have two dogs who feature in the background noise of my recordings. I'm a brown belt in BJJ, which has taught me more about learning than any course I've taken. I volunteer as a Samaritan, which has taught me more about listening. And I'm teaching myself piano again after decades away, which is teaching me about patience.

I'm interested in how things connect - how the same patterns show up in different domains, how friction shapes behaviour, how tools change what's thinkable.
