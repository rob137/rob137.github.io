# About

I'm Rob Kirby. I live near Oxford and work as a software engineer at a portfolio software company, currently focused on AI and LLMs.

Before software I was an Intelligence Corps officer in the British Army. Before that I studied philosophy. The through-line is probably something about information and how to make sense of it.

This blog is where I write about things I'm noticing. See also: [what I'm doing now](/now/).
