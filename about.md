# About

I'm Rob Kirby. Software engineer at a portfolio software company, currently focused on AI and LLMs.

Before software I was an intelligence corps officer in the British Army. Before that I studied philosophy. The through-line is probably something about information and how to make sense of it.

Father of three. Two dogs. Brown belt in BJJ. Volunteer Samaritan. Currently teaching myself piano again after a long break.

This blog is where I write about things I'm noticing.
