# Blog Post Backlog

Ideas extracted from ambient recordings and conversations.

---

## Published

### Voice-First: The Future of Talking to Machines
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Speech as input is the future. Just-in-time learning through conversation. "I can do audio engineering now - it's like the Matrix."

### How This Blog Exists
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** The friction collapse. Set up a blog via phone prompts while parenting. Ambient content pipeline.

### The GUI Was a Detour
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Software makes you think about two things: your problem AND its mental model. LLMs let you think only about your problem. The barrier is scoping, not coding.

### Respecting the Fence
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Chesterton's fence - LLMs let you respect bureaucratic processes without being crushed by them. The vicar/church story. Intelligence corps background.

### Books as Compressed Prompts
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Book titles are pointers to compressed mental models LLMs already know. Reading leverage is higher than ever - people reading less, payoff greater.

### Crossing the Horizon
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** A step change in model capability that went unrecognized for weeks. The practitioner's view - "I don't understand transformers but I know when the instrument changes." Teacher marking homework, colleague using terminal, broader implications. Event horizon metaphor - crossing feels normal locally, but there's no way back.

### The Music Stopped
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** IDE vs terminal debate is becoming irrelevant - not because one won, but because the underlying activity changed. Edit (maybe), chat, review. The desire lines are clear. Includes Yegge quote, Ousterhout naming styles, personality attractors.

### Intermediary Times
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Industrial Revolution parallel - net positive but expensive in the intermediary times. Social contract concerns. Not accelerationist or doomer - eye of the beholder.

### How I Keep Up
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** X.com is unreasonably good if you follow the right people. 80/20 sources: Simon Willison's blog and Latent Space. Health warning about dopaminergic loops and context switching costs.

### Golden Retriever Problem
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** The helpful assistant persona is a "radio on TV" transitional form. The ideal employee isn't a helpful assistant - true for humans, and once models reach competence, wrong for them too. Staff engineer comparison. This is fixable.

### To-Do Lists as Prompts
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Writing detailed to-do items is actually writing prompts. Speech-to-text makes this easier than typing laconic notes. Rather than keeping prompts, you might just send them. Fire and forget with worktrees. Bake in success criteria and validation.

### Last Bastion
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Samaritans as pure human-touch work. LLMs can already do active listening well. The service filters for people comfortable calling strangers - what about those who aren't? Not proposing anything, just observing what seems inevitable. If even this isn't safe, what is?

### Show, Don't Tell
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Prosumer decision-making. Spent 2 hours finding a product via LLM iteration - then realized showing past purchases (without explanation) got the right answer immediately. LLMs drawing parallels, associative thinking, category hopping. Links to golden retriever problem. Open-ended musings.

### YOLO Mode
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Every abstraction leap has a liminal period where the new thing is dismissed. What's "YOLO" becomes normal - web devs never read assembly output anymore. Current debates about line-level vs commit-level vs PR-level review may all become quaint. Yegge's "Gas Town" as evidence of where things are heading.

---

### Witnesses
**Published:** 2026-01-03
**Core idea:** Opens with John Blow's skepticism as the bar to meet. Then presents quotes from respected programmers expressing genuine surprise - Jaana Dogan, ESR, Yegge, Gene Kim, Karpathy, Hassabis, Brin. List will grow.

**Still collecting:** Mitchell Hashimoto quote/screenshot.

### Too Comfortable
**Published:** 2026-01-03
**Core idea:** Terminal agents stable for a year (Aider → Claude Code). Jeff Tang satire captures the churn. Huang's law, Leopold Aschenbrenner/Sutskever on scaling. If 4x every 18 months continues, current comfort should feel suspicious.

### First Contact
**Published:** 2026-01-03
**Core idea:** Three military concepts for AI agents: mission command (what not how), orders process (plan thoroughly, hold loosely), inkblot strategy (agency spreads organically). Intelligence Corps background, Sandhurst, Para Reg.

### Pliers
**Published:** 2026-01-03
**Core idea:** Software engineers' blue-collar fantasies. Attachment to physical tools (pliers) paralleling attachment to coding paradigms that are becoming obsolete. What to do with attachment when tools change this fast?

---

### Is It Cheating?
**Published:** 2026-01-03
**Core idea:** Warfare analogy - technology arrives, gets called dishonorable, rules shift. Meta description of the dictation workflow. Copywriter parallel (CEO articles aren't written by CEOs). The filter of writing vs speech. Orders of magnitude more output.

### Position Before Submission
**Published:** 2026-01-03
**Core idea:** BJJ parallel. Early exhaustion vs efficient black belts. "Spending surprise" as the new debt - stay in the training distribution. Principle of least surprise (162 mentions in chat history). Position before submission = make architecture obvious so models just know.

### Interview Question
**Published:** 2026-01-03
**Core idea:** Calculator app task that's now one-shottable. "Yeah, whatever you like" soundboard. Looking for product ownership over technical depth. "Calculator" used to be a job title - software engineer heading somewhere similar.

### Brooks' Law Redux
**Published:** 2026-01-03
**Core idea:** Human friction becoming the bottleneck. "The Goal" theory - as AI speeds everything up, interpersonal coordination sticks out. "The worst thing anyone could say is that someone else is going to work on it with me." Optimal engineers approaching zero. Jevons Paradox on project count. Metal Gear Solid exclamation mark ending.

### You Just Get Used to It
**Published:** 2026-01-04
**Core idea:** Trust, testimony, and dogs. Most knowledge is testimonial. AI subverts normal responsibility attribution. Dogs co-evolved with humans - human-facing traits but unexpected bits underneath. Von Neumann: "you don't understand things, you just get used to them."

### The Next Rung
**Published:** 2026-01-04
**Core idea:** Aider felt premature a year ago, now everyone's on Claude Code. Agent orchestration (Gas Town) in the same early phase. The pattern: each rung of the abstraction ladder seems less than serious until suddenly ubiquitous.

### The Raft and the Ladder
**Published:** 2026-01-04
**Core idea:** Buddhist raft and Wittgenstein's ladder as metaphors for letting go. Enterprise context: will AI lead to skipping learning? Industrial Revolution parallel. Alan Kay and Jonathan Blow on the existing expertise problem. The temptation of task completion dopamine. Ends by rejecting both metaphors: the question isn't whether to let go, it's whether you've grasped it in the first place.

### Expanding Universe
**Published:** 2026-01-04
**Core idea:** Spectrum of AI coding experiences. Flippers (Karpathy, DHH) vs holdouts (Hotz, Primeagen, Blow). Domain matters (web/enterprise vs systems/game engines), but so does when you last looked. Links back to Crossing the Horizon.

**To do:** Use Grok queries on X to find more recent statements from holdouts (Hotz, Primeagen, Blow) - Claude can't access the API.

### Blank Page
**Published:** 2026-01-04
**Core idea:** ADHD-like symptoms (2am essay paralysis, excruciation at starting) have disappeared with LLMs. Work became like playing Nintendo - dopaminergic, compounding. Burnout assumptions may be wrong when work is fun. Certain personality types were failure modes but now thrive. Open question: would different personalities dominate software engineering if tools froze?

### Fresh and Stale
**Published:** 2026-01-04
**Core idea:** Ideas captured immediately vs saved for later. About half the posts have been from backlog out of necessity, but the flow is lower if you don't grab the iron while it's hot. The infrastructure: speech to text + Tailscale + frontier models + copywriter on phone. Volume compounds. From WhatsApp conversation with James.

### Field Recording
**Published:** 2026-01-05
**Core idea:** Left hemisphere bait, right hemisphere activity. Field recording videos all detour into meditation. Dad's bird watching as parallel. Daniel Ingram's maps, contemplative traditions converging. McGilchrist quote. AI twist: engineers expanding beyond single domains because they're no longer stuck at knowledge gaps.

### Invisible Capability Line
**Published:** 2026-01-04
**Core idea:** Simon Willison on GPT-5.2/Opus 4.5 as inflection point - hard to know where the capability line is until you crash into it. Links to Crossing the Horizon.

### Parachute
**Published:** 2026-01-05
**Core idea:** Junior developers moving ridiculously fast on starter projects. Experience should be higher leverage than before, yet juniors keep shipping. The real variable: solo developers get all the benefits of avoiding Brooks' Law. Inexperience might hurt in aggregate, but being unconstrained by coordination overhead offsets the cost.

### Aiming Off
**Published:** 2026-01-05
**Core idea:** Orienteering technique - deliberately aim to one side so you know which way to turn. When everything's moving, you have to aim where the target will be. ESR's YERD project (LLMs writing CRUD apps). Early web/open source hackers built for a world that didn't exist. Eternal September. Position before submission, inkblot strategy.

## Backlog

### How Hiring Has Changed
**Status:** Idea - reading Joel Spolsky's book
**Core idea:** Reflections on how hiring has changed in the AI era. Reading Joel Spolsky's hiring book (based on his blog). More to come.

### The Great Attractor
**Status:** Idea
**Core idea:** Certain general-purpose, convenient devices/apps attract all functionality. Story: got a Hanklight after much deliberation (link to frugality post), but ended up just using phone light. Barely open laptop now - phone browser does 90%, happy to slam it for the rest. This is coming for AI. Terminal-based coding tools are already general-purpose computing interfaces - command line can do all knowledge work, but most knowledge workers are scared of it. Reference colleague James: non-technical, hasn't written code, but now uses terminal-based tools as primary interface for his role. Reference Audacity being sidelined (GUI Was a Detour). Note: check if too many "The X" titles, and whether cosmological references are getting hammy after Expanding Universe.

### Corsair
**Status:** Idea
**Core idea:** Built an Emacs tool called Corsair (top project on GitHub). Already obsolete. The workflow it supported is no longer relevant following terminal-based agents and IDE-integrated tools. Personal example of how fast things are moving.

### Gateway Drug
**Status:** Idea
**Core idea:** GitHub Copilot as weird gateway drug into neurology and philosophy of intelligence. All roads lead to the brain - the only existence proof of what people call AGI. Suspicion that AGI is in the eye of the beholder, deeply anthropocentric definition. Beff Jezos on Lex Fridman: extended quote about many other forms of intelligence and the term AGI being anthropocentric. Find the quote.

### The Intermediary Times (Part Two)
**Status:** Idea - needs research
**Core idea:** Individual accounts of how people handled the Industrial Revolution. Automation of their roles, personal experiences of the transition. Follow-up to the original Intermediary Times post. Requires digging into books or historical sources for first-person accounts.
