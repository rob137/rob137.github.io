# Blog Post Backlog

Ideas extracted from ambient recordings and conversations.

### How Hiring Has Changed
**Status:** Idea - reading Joel Spolsky's book
**Core idea:** Reflections on how hiring has changed in the AI era. Reading Joel Spolsky's hiring book (based on his blog). More to come.

### The Intermediary Times (Part Two)
**Status:** Idea - needs research
**Core idea:** Individual accounts of how people handled the Industrial Revolution. Automation of their roles, personal experiences of the transition. Follow-up to the original Intermediary Times post. Requires digging into books or historical sources for first-person accounts.

### Roving Bridge / The Octopus
**Status:** Idea
**Core idea:** Bridge 77 on the Macclesfield Canal - a roving bridge designed so the tow horse could cross without being untethered. The horse didn't need to understand the bridge's design, it just followed the path. Metaphor for git worktrees: suddenly easy without humans ever having to figure out how they work, because Claude Code manages them. Setup: central Claude Code instance ("the octopus") presiding over the repo, tasking sub-LLMs on feature branches in worktrees. Each sub-LLM works on a feature branch, central LLM arbitrates quality, tests run on central branch, reviews PRs one at a time with user oversight. Degrees of separation from the human - the closer to the centre, the closer to me. Image: Bridge 77 photo in Downloads.

### Infinite Dimensions / Joe Weisenthal
**Status:** Raw brain dump
**Notes:** [weisenthal-infinite-dimensions.md](/_notes/weisenthal-infinite-dimensions.md)
**Core idea:** In infinitely dimensional space, everything is close. AI tools are infinitely dimensional in how they affect work. Joe Weisenthal (Odd Lots podcast) is now coding with Claude Code, working on a "primary orality" project to detect natural spoken language. This shouldn't be surprising - all roads lead here. Thread through: Wittgenstein → philosophy → meeting intellectual lions → Taleb as taste curator → Odd Lots → convergence of disciplines around AI tools.

### Transformers Within Reach
**Status:** Raw transcript
**Notes:** [transformers-within-reach.md](/_notes/transformers-within-reach.md)
**Related:** [Useful, Not True](/2026/01/24/thinking-out-loud/)
**Core idea:** How esoteric-seeming LLM/transformer workings are surprisingly within reach. Transformer research full of physicists not CS people because barrier to entry is low. "Normies" can grok this faster than expected. The mental model has high economic value. 3Blue1Brown video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPZh9BOjkQs

### The Perception Gap (consolidated: 2026 Isn't 2025 / Falling Asleep / Childlike Trust)
**Status:** Raw transcript
**Notes:** [human-in-the-loop-bottleneck.md](/_notes/human-in-the-loop-bottleneck.md)
**Core idea:** Humans can't perceive exponentials. Gap between years growing but apparent change shrinking. Losing felt sense without realizing - a kind of sleep. The "cautious adults" are actually falling asleep. Childlike trust becomes the adult position when the "adults" are on Q2 2025 assumptions. Connects to The False Middle.

### Factory Sandwiches (consolidated with Exiting Hyperspace)
**Status:** Raw transcript
**Notes:** [human-in-the-loop-bottleneck.md](/_notes/human-in-the-loop-bottleneck.md)
**Core idea:** Human-in-the-loop becoming bottleneck. "Exiting hyperspace every time I need to communicate." Economy isn't designed around humans - we contort to fit it. 80% at 1000x efficiency makes the 20% irrelevant. Hand woven baskets, horse riding as recreation. Bangladesh suits. Quality dips then blasts past artisan levels. Artisanal concerns come from artisans who might get sidelined. Have used this analogy at work including on internal corporate podcast.
