Ideas extracted from ambient recordings and conversations.

## Published

### Voice-First: The Future of Talking to Machines
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Speech as input is the future. Just-in-time learning through conversation. "I can do audio engineering now - it's like the Matrix."
**Incorporated:** Audio engineering anecdote, JIT learning, not being "the type" to enter that domain

### How This Blog Exists
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** The friction collapse. Set up a blog via phone prompts while parenting. Ambient content pipeline.

### The GUI Was a Detour
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Software makes you think about two things: your problem AND its mental model. LLMs let you think only about your problem. The barrier is scoping, not coding.
**Incorporated:** Desktop software obsolescence thesis, JIT code, throwaway code economy

### Respecting the Fence
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Chesterton's fence - LLMs let you respect bureaucratic processes without being crushed by them. The vicar/church story. Intelligence corps background. 2026 is the year everyone finds out.

## Ideas to Develop

### Domain-Hopping Musings (working title)
**Source:** Transcript + conversation
**Core idea:** Possibly combine audio engineering / electrical engineering into a "musings" post. The point isn't the specific domain - it's the gleeful traversal across domains. Intellectual signalling without being explicit about it.

**Elements to potentially include:**
- "It's straight to electrical engineering, which has never made any sense to me, but it's suddenly really interesting"
- Three approaches to technical problems (environment, hardware, software) - not as a framework to teach, but as an example of how I naturally categorize things
- The feeling of "downloading" skills Matrix-style
- LLMs lower the curiosity barrier - you can ask *why* things work

**Note:** Don't make the lesson too overt. Let the musings speak for themselves.

## Raw Notes / Future Mining

- The entire transcript captures kids making potions while dad explains LLMs to wife - the juxtaposition of domestic chaos and technical discussion
- Dog training (positive reinforcement with treats) happening alongside work - multitasking as a theme
- "Better than paying 40 quid for soft play" - the economics of how we spend time/money with kids
- Five-year-old Edie walking home independently - children gaining independence
