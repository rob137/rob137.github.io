Ideas extracted from ambient recordings and conversations.

### How Hiring Has Changed
**Status:** Idea - reading Joel Spolsky's book
**Core idea:** Reflections on how hiring has changed in the AI era. Reading Joel Spolsky's hiring book (based on his blog). More to come.

### Corsair
**Status:** Idea
**Core idea:** Built an Emacs tool called Corsair (top project on GitHub). Already obsolete. The workflow it supported is no longer relevant following terminal-based agents and IDE-integrated tools. Personal example of how fast things are moving.

### The Intermediary Times (Part Two)
**Status:** Idea - needs research
**Core idea:** Individual accounts of how people handled the Industrial Revolution. Automation of their roles, personal experiences of the transition. Follow-up to the original Intermediary Times post. Requires digging into books or historical sources for first-person accounts.
