## Ready to Write

### Navigating Bureaucracy with AI
**Source:** Conversation about helping a local church
**Core idea:** A parish church often does social work - helping people navigate complex systems for support. One case involved completing dense government paperwork: hundreds of lines of thick documentation that had become a bottleneck. With informed consent (privacy risks made explicit), we used an LLM. The prompt: "there is this well-known form in your training data, fill out these sections based on the materials" - and it just worked.

**Key angles:**
- Privacy considerations with informed consent (made risks clear, got explicit permission before proceeding)
- The pattern: dump documents in a directory, ask AI to do the work
- Generalizable to many document-processing tasks (intelligence work, legal, medical, benefits)
- This capability exists *now* but hasn't been "priced in" by society
- The TUI interface means people don't realize how accessible this is
- People can't adjust priors at the rate AI is advancing
- The train may be past the station by the time anyone realizes

**The kicker:** I'm just a software engineer and father of three - no background in this domain whatsoever. Hobbies, responsibilities, a million things pulling at me. It was *trivial* to execute. The domain experts QC'd the output, found almost nothing wrong - just a few style tweaks, submitted, done. No substantive effort invested.

The only barrier was framing the problem correctly - and the problem happened to be well within the training data distribution. Standard government forms are in there. The knowledge of how to fill them out is in there. The bottleneck was never the AI's capability; it was someone knowing to try.

**Potential title:** "The Paperwork Problem" or "What AI Can Already Do (That No One Has Noticed)" or "The Only Barrier Is Knowing To Try"

**Note:** Keep details abstract - the point is the pattern, not the specific case.

### "I Can Do Audio Engineering Now"
**Source:** Transcript 020126_105326, lines 125-203
**Core idea:** Learning audio engineering concepts (gain, preamps, noise reduction, dB levels) through conversation with an LLM while processing actual recordings.

**Key quotes:**
- "I can do audio engineering now. It's just like Matrix, it's ridiculous."
- "This is why I love it, because it's straight to electrical engineering, which has never made any sense to me, but it's suddenly really interesting"

**Angles:**
- Just-in-time learning in context of real tasks
- Technical domains becoming accessible to non-specialists
- The feeling of "downloading" skills Matrix-style

### Desktop Software Is Becoming Obsolete
**Source:** Transcript 020126_105326, lines 155-190
**Core idea:** GUI applications existed to lower the activation energy for using powerful CLI tools. LLMs lower it further by generating the commands.

**Key quotes:**
- "That's what desktop software was for. You had to learn how to use that as well. Now I'm just skipping it altogether."
- "FFMPEG is a command line utility, it can do all the things"
- "You make the software just in time"

**Angles:**
- Audacity vs. ffmpeg commands generated on demand
- The economics of learning software
- What categories of software become obsolete first?
- The "JIT code" concept - disposable, use-once scripts

## Ideas to Develop

### Three Approaches to Technical Problems
**Source:** Transcript 020126_105326, lines 134-142
**Core idea:** When dealing with technical problems (audio was the example), there are three approaches:
1. Control the environment (physics - move mic closer, acoustic treatment)
2. Better hardware (preamps, quality equipment)
3. Fix in software (post-production, noise reduction)

**Potential angle:** This framework generalizes beyond audio. What other domains have this structure?

### Electrical Engineering Suddenly Becomes Interesting
**Source:** Transcript 020126_105326, line 133
**Core idea:** "It's straight to electrical engineering, which has never made any sense to me, but it's suddenly really interesting, because of this"

**Angle:** LLMs make previously opaque technical domains interesting because you can ask *why* things work and get explanations in context. The curiosity barrier is lowered.

## Raw Notes / Future Mining

- The entire transcript captures kids making potions while dad explains LLMs to wife - the juxtaposition of domestic chaos and technical discussion
- Dog training (positive reinforcement with treats) happening alongside work - multitasking as a theme
- "Better than paying 40 quid for soft play" - the economics of how we spend time/money with kids
- Five-year-old Edie walking home independently - children gaining independence, parallels to AI independence?
