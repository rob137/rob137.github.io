# Blog Post Backlog

Ideas extracted from ambient recordings and conversations.

## Published

### Voice-First: The Future of Talking to Machines
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Speech as input is the future. Just-in-time learning through conversation. "I can do audio engineering now - it's like the Matrix."

### How This Blog Exists
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** The friction collapse. Set up a blog via phone prompts while parenting. Ambient content pipeline.

### The GUI Was a Detour
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Software makes you think about two things: your problem AND its mental model. LLMs let you think only about your problem. The barrier is scoping, not coding.

### Respecting the Fence
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Chesterton's fence - LLMs let you respect bureaucratic processes without being crushed by them. The vicar/church story. Intelligence corps background.

### Books as Compressed Prompts
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Book titles are pointers to compressed mental models LLMs already know. Reading leverage is higher than ever - people reading less, payoff greater.

### Something Happened
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** A step change in model capability that went unrecognized for weeks. The practitioner's view - "I don't understand transformers but I know when the instrument changes." Teacher marking homework, colleague using terminal, broader implications.

### The Music Stopped
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** IDE vs terminal debate is becoming irrelevant - not because one won, but because the underlying activity changed. Edit (maybe), chat, review. The desire lines are clear. Includes Yegge quote, Ousterhout naming styles, personality attractors.

## Ideas to Develop

### Domain-Hopping Musings (working title)
**Source:** Transcript + conversation
**Core idea:** Possibly combine audio engineering / electrical engineering into a "musings" post. The point isn't the specific domain - it's the gleeful traversal across domains. Intellectual signalling without being explicit about it.

**Elements to potentially include:**
- "It's straight to electrical engineering, which has never made any sense to me, but it's suddenly really interesting"
- Three approaches to technical problems (environment, hardware, software) - not as a framework to teach, but as an example of how I naturally categorize things
- The feeling of "downloading" skills Matrix-style
- LLMs lower the curiosity barrier - you can ask *why* things work

**Note:** Don't make the lesson too overt. Let the musings speak for themselves.

### Industrial Revolution Parallel (possible future post)
**Source:** Conversation about "Something Happened"
**Core idea:** The industrial revolution was profoundly good for humanity (child mortality down, literacy up, MRI machines, vaccines, foreign holidays, Ben & Jerry's) but also expensive in the intermediary times (world wars, cold war). Disruption can cause death even while bringing greater good. The social contract question. Not sure if accelerationist or doomer - eye of the beholder.

**Note:** User explicitly said this might be for another time, not the current post. Handle with care.

### Who to Follow (compiling)
**Source:** Conversation
**Core idea:** A list of people worth following in the AI/LLM space. Not ready to write yet, just collecting names.

**People to include:**
- Simon Willison
- Steve Yegge
- Beyang Liu (Sourcegraph)
- Quinn Slack (Sourcegraph)
- Thorsten Ball (Sourcegraph)
- swyx (Latent Space, coined "AI engineer")
- Andrej Karpathy
- Dwarkesh Patel (Dwarkesh Podcast)
- Yacine / kache (@yacineMTB)
- Boris Cherny
- (add more as they come up)

**Notes:**
- Could discuss what makes someone worth following vs just noisy
- The groupthink on X.com - prolific accounts playing to the crowd
- Who actually has signal

## Raw Notes / Future Mining

- The entire transcript captures kids making potions while dad explains LLMs to wife - the juxtaposition of domestic chaos and technical discussion
- Dog training (positive reinforcement with treats) happening alongside work - multitasking as a theme
- "Better than paying 40 quid for soft play" - the economics of how we spend time/money with kids
- Five-year-old Edie walking home independently - children gaining independence
