# Blog Post Backlog

Ideas extracted from ambient recordings and conversations.

---

## Published

### Voice-First: The Future of Talking to Machines
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Speech as input is the future. Just-in-time learning through conversation. "I can do audio engineering now - it's like the Matrix."

### How This Blog Exists
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** The friction collapse. Set up a blog via phone prompts while parenting. Ambient content pipeline.

### The GUI Was a Detour
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Software makes you think about two things: your problem AND its mental model. LLMs let you think only about your problem. The barrier is scoping, not coding.

### Respecting the Fence
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Chesterton's fence - LLMs let you respect bureaucratic processes without being crushed by them. The vicar/church story. Intelligence corps background.

### Books as Compressed Prompts
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Book titles are pointers to compressed mental models LLMs already know. Reading leverage is higher than ever - people reading less, payoff greater.

### Crossing the Horizon
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** A step change in model capability that went unrecognized for weeks. The practitioner's view - "I don't understand transformers but I know when the instrument changes." Teacher marking homework, colleague using terminal, broader implications. Event horizon metaphor - crossing feels normal locally, but there's no way back.

### The Music Stopped
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** IDE vs terminal debate is becoming irrelevant - not because one won, but because the underlying activity changed. Edit (maybe), chat, review. The desire lines are clear. Includes Yegge quote, Ousterhout naming styles, personality attractors.

### The Intermediary Times
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Industrial Revolution parallel - net positive but expensive in the intermediary times. Social contract concerns. Not accelerationist or doomer - eye of the beholder.

### How I Keep Up
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** X.com is unreasonably good if you follow the right people. 80/20 sources: Simon Willison's blog and Latent Space. Health warning about dopaminergic loops and context switching costs.

### The Golden Retriever Problem
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** The helpful assistant persona is a "radio on TV" transitional form. The ideal employee isn't a helpful assistant - true for humans, and once models reach competence, wrong for them too. Staff engineer comparison. This is fixable.

### To-Do Lists as Prompts
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Writing detailed to-do items is actually writing prompts. Speech-to-text makes this easier than typing laconic notes. Rather than keeping prompts, you might just send them. Fire and forget with worktrees. Bake in success criteria and validation.

### The Last Bastion
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Samaritans as pure human-touch work. LLMs can already do active listening well. The service filters for people comfortable calling strangers - what about those who aren't? Not proposing anything, just observing what seems inevitable. If even this isn't safe, what is?

### Show, Don't Tell
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Prosumer decision-making. Spent 2 hours finding a product via LLM iteration - then realized showing past purchases (without explanation) got the right answer immediately. LLMs drawing parallels, associative thinking, category hopping. Links to golden retriever problem. Open-ended musings.

### YOLO Mode
**Published:** 2026-01-02
**Core idea:** Every abstraction leap has a liminal period where the new thing is dismissed. What's "YOLO" becomes normal - web devs never read assembly output anymore. Current debates about line-level vs commit-level vs PR-level review may all become quaint. Yegge's "Gas Town" as evidence of where things are heading.

## Collecting

### Baffled Builders
**Status:** Collecting examples (need 3-5)
**Core idea:** Genuine bafflement from well-known, respected programmers - people with Wikipedia pages for actually building things. Not AI startup people, not people who've shifted into AI work. Real names, real credentials, real surprise.

**Collected so far:**
- **Jaana Dogan (@rakyll)** - Senior Google engineer. "I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour." (Jan 2026)
- **Eric S. Raymond** - Similar reactions to aider, early 2025. (Find exact quote)
- **Mitchell Hashimoto** - HashiCorp founder (Vagrant, Terraform). (Find quote)
- **Steve Yegge** - Amazon, Google, Sourcegraph. "We all knew this was coming, but nobody knew it would be here now."
- **Gene Kim** - The Phoenix Project, DevOps Handbook. Told Claude Code to run cURL itself, 45 seconds later it said "I tried six different iterations and got it working." For Gene, that was "life changing."

**Need:** Have 5, could add more if spotted.
