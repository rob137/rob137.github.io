Two metaphors for letting go of what you've learned.

The Buddha, in the [Alagaddupama Sutta](https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/buddhist-parable-of-the-raft/), describes a man who builds a raft to cross a river:

> This raft has been very helpful to me... Why don't I beach it on dry land or set it adrift on the water and go wherever I want?

The teaching is a raft. It's for crossing over, not for holding on. Once you've reached the other shore, carrying it with you only slows you down.

Wittgenstein, at the end of the [Tractatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittgenstein%27s_ladder):

> My propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he has used them – as steps – to climb up beyond them. (He must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it.)

The ladder gets you somewhere. Then you don't need it anymore.

## The question

Both metaphors point the same direction: what got you here isn't necessarily what takes you forward. But there's a difference between them.

With a raft, you leave the shore behind entirely. You can't go back. The river is crossed.

With a ladder, you've climbed somewhere - but you can still look down. The rungs are still there, even if you've stopped standing on them.

I don't know which is the better model for rapidly obsoleting skills. Maybe it depends where you are in the stack.

## The stack

Some layers feel more like rafts. The [attachment to physical tools](/2026/01/03/the-pliers/) - the sense that real work involves tangible things - might be something you simply leave behind. You cross over into a different relationship with work, and the old shore fades.

Other layers feel more like ladders. Understanding how things work underneath still helps, even if you're not directly using that knowledge. Abstraction doesn't erase what came before - it builds on it. You can still look down.

And some areas might be stubborn. The whole stack won't shift at once. There'll be places where the old skills stay relevant for years, while everything around them changes. The [expanding universe](/2026/01/02/yolo-mode/) of practice - different domains diverging at different rates.

## The loss

Either way, there's something lost. Skills you worked hard to acquire becoming vestigial. Knowledge that used to matter, mattering less.

It's like learning to drive. At first, every action is conscious - mirror, signal, manoeuvre. Eventually it becomes automatic. You stop thinking about it. The explicit knowledge fades into something implicit, something you can't even articulate anymore.

Maybe that's not loss. Maybe it's just what expertise looks like from the other side.

But it feels like loss, sometimes. And I think that's worth acknowledging rather than pretending it's pure gain.

## The paradox

The skills that got you here may slow you down now. But you couldn't have skipped them. You needed the raft to cross the river. You needed the ladder to climb.

The question isn't whether to let go. It's whether you're on the other shore yet - or still mid-crossing, holding tight.
