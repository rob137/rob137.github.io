A recurring pattern in the history of warfare: technology arrives and changes the game. The crossbow. Plate armour. The musket. Each time, there's a period where the new approach is considered dishonorable - a violation of chivalric code, an affront to martial culture.

Regiments that built their identity around a particular way of fighting either adapt or maintain their traditions at great cost. Eventually the rules shift. There are still armoured regiments in the British Army known as cavalry, but there are no horses. The Parachute Regiment still conducts static-line jumps as part of training and regimental routine, but it's not something any of them do in combat these days.

The rituals persist. The practical reality moves on.

## Right now

Here's how I'm writing this post.

I'm walking the dogs and pushing my eighteen-month-old daughter in the pram while she sleeps. I have a Bluetooth headset on - a Jabra that picks up voice well against background noise. My Android phone is in my pocket with the recorder running.

When I'm done, I'll open the recorder app, tap share, and Tailscale will appear in the list. One tap sends the file to my laptop. I'll switch to Termux, which is already connected to an active tmux session running Claude Code, and say: "There's an audio file. Transcribe it and write the post."

The model will transcribe the audio, write it up, commit it, push to GitHub, where a pipeline - also set up entirely by the model - publishes it to the blog.

I haven't written a line of code for any of this. More than that: I haven't sat down at a keyboard and typed any of the posts. I dictate ideas - sometimes quite rough, full of bobbing and weaving, changing my mind mid-sentence. The model turns it into written form.

So far it's working better than I could do myself. Not just faster - more faithful to my ideas. I'm prone to distraction when writing. Less so when talking.

## The copywriter

A friend of mine works as a copywriter. He told me something that's apparently an open secret in the industry: when you see an article in a newspaper or business magazine written by a CEO, it is almost never written by that person.

What happens is this. The CEO approves something in note form - maybe a few bullet points, maybe a recorded conversation. It gets sent to a copywriting shop. Someone like my friend writes a draft. It bounces back and forth between agencies until everyone's happy. Then it gets published with the CEO's name on it.

Is that cheating?

I suppose in some sense it is, if you're putting a name on something you didn't write. Except it's done everywhere, has been for decades, to the point where getting shrill about it would feel naive.

## The filter

I mentioned in [an earlier post](/2026/01/02/the-last-bastion.html) that the Samaritans service filters for people comfortable calling strangers on the phone. If you're not that person, you're less likely to reach out - even if you need help.

Writing has a similar filter. You need time, inclination, comfort with the medium. The people who write are the people who clear those hurdles. Everyone else stays quiet.

Dictation changes that. Speech is more natural than typing for most people. The friction drops. More thoughts make it out into the world.

## The question

I could write this myself. I can type, and I have in the past. But I'm producing more now - orders of magnitude more - than I ever did when writing was the bottleneck.

Is it cheating? Or is it just how things work now?

I think the rules are shifting. They usually do.
