This is my first blog post. I've set up this site using Jekyll and GitHub Pages, which means I can write posts in Markdown and have them automatically published.

## Why start a blog?

Writing helps clarify thinking. By explaining ideas, I understand them better myself. A blog is also a good way to document things I've learned that might help others.

## What to expect

I'll be writing about:

- Software development
- Technology and tools I find useful
- Problems I've solved and lessons learned
- Whatever else seems worth sharing

## How this site works

This blog is built with Jekyll, a static site generator. Here's the workflow:

1. Write a post in Markdown
2. Save it in the `_posts` folder with the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
3. Push to GitHub
4. GitHub Pages builds and deploys automatically

No databases, no server management, just simple files.

That's all there is to it. Looking forward to writing more soon.
