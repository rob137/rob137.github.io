excerpt: "Comfortable and laziest aren't the same thing."
---

When I learned Vim, the tool was fast but my brain was slow. Seconds of latency while I tried to remember key bindings. Mentally taxing.

I developed a habit, common in guides for this: when I caught myself doing something that worked but wasn't ideal - hitting the arrow key five times instead of pressing `e` for end of word - I'd go back and do it correctly. Sometimes three times, to hammer it in.

Before long, fluency made the stragglers easy. It became addictive. The speed of navigating a codebase reflects your comfort with the tool. Mastery in a video game.

## Universal Interfaces

Vim is a universal interface within its bounded context - files, text, references. Terminal-based agents are a universal interface within theirs. And the bounded context of a computer is extremely wide.

I'm struggling to find things I can't do from the terminal as smoothly as I can manually:

- Write documents, move files, just by talking
- Open any application
- Play media
- Research via web search
- Pull CSVs, crunch numbers in Python

The other day I realised I was still using ticketing and repository web UIs when the APIs, CLIs and MCPs were all available. The models were happy to create PRs, open pages in my browser, copy links to my clipboard.

## Voice

My primary interface is voice now. I basically don't type. Excluding pauses, I'm at about 300 words per minute speaking. Typing, maybe a third of that. Meanwhile the perceived effort is low because talking comes naturally.

## The Point

Comfortable and laziest aren't the same thing. The sysadmin who calls themselves lazy but writes tons of automation code - they're the real thing. Actually lazy. They keep asking whether something should be manual at all.

I've got decades of habits that went from good to bad overnight. This week I've found myself back where I was learning Vim - catching myself doing the comfortable thing, then going back to do it right, in the understanding that there's probably only a future for one approach.

Anthropic just announced [Claude for Enterprise](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-for-enterprise) - a more accessible interface for automating ordinary work tasks. The labs are making inroads. 2026 will probably be the year this goes mainstream.
