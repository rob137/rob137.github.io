I keep coming back to this video. A woman making music by editing JavaScript while the loop runs. She's not writing notes. She's tweaking the rules that govern what happens next. The music plays continuously; she intervenes, adjusts, listens, adjusts again.

This is what software engineering is becoming.

The pipeline runs. Agents pick up tickets, write code, submit PRs, review each other's work. You're not in there writing the code. You're watching the loop, and when you see a pattern you don't like, you update a prompt. You enrich the instructions. You give better guidance. The loop keeps running. It's orchestration, not composition.

The agents are stateless. Think of a contracting project manager who comes in fresh - they don't know the history of your project, they just look at the board. If seeing the board is enough to act, then it works. That's how this runs. Git is the system of record. Issues are the coordination layer. The agent sees current state, makes a decision, moves on. No context window growing forever. No conversation history. Just the board.

We started with ChatGPT and I thought of it as a conversation - a growing sequence of messages. But that's not what this is. When you have a system of record and a ticketing system, you've got a different base entirely. The agent isn't remembering what you said yesterday. It's looking at what's true right now in git, what's open in issues, and acting on that. Conversations are linear. This isn't.

Until now I've had a rough sense of where this is all heading, and I think I've been largely accurate. This is the first time I can't see past the horizon. Make the models 10x more reliable, 10x more capable - what changes? Maybe you automate more of the orchestration. But the shape feels right. Loop running, human intervening, system of record underneath.

Maybe that's the ceiling. Maybe I just can't see further yet.
