excerpt: "The loop runs. You tweak the rules."

I keep coming back to this video. A woman making music by editing JavaScript while the loop runs. She's not writing notes. She's tweaking the rules that govern what happens next. The music plays continuously; she intervenes, adjusts, listens, adjusts again.

This is what software engineering is becoming.

The pipeline runs. Agents pick up tickets, write code, submit PRs, review each other's work. You're not in there writing the code. You're watching the loop, and when you see a pattern you don't like, you update a prompt. You give better guidance. The loop keeps running. It's orchestration, not composition.

When ChatGPT came out, you naturally thought of it as conversation - a growing sequence of messages, you and the model taking turns. But there was always the option to hook in other stuff. A spreadsheet. A codebase. Jira plus GitHub. Once you do that, the data can change under the model's feet while you work. Very quickly, you're not talking to a chatbot anymore. You're having an LLM-infused interaction with a data source. And the form of the tool changes completely depending on what you plug it into - the same way Excel can be accounting software or a wedding planner depending on what's in the cells.

Git becomes the system of record. Issues become the coordination layer. The agents are stateless - like a contracting project manager who comes in fresh and just looks at the board. If the board is enough to act on, it works. No context window growing forever. No conversation history. Just current state, decision, move on.

Until now I've had a rough sense of where this is all heading, and I think I've been largely accurate. This is the first time I can't see past the horizon. Make the models 10x more reliable, 10x more capable - what changes? Maybe you automate more of the orchestration. But the shape feels right. Loop running, human intervening, system of record underneath.

Maybe that's the ceiling. Maybe I just can't see further yet.
