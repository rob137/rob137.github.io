A year ago, there was roughly one way to be a professional software developer. You wrote code. The tools varied, the languages varied, but the core activity was the same.

Now there's a spectrum. Some developers ship entire applications without writing code by hand. Others find AI tools net-negative for their work. Both approaches are viable. Both produce working software.

The universe is expanding.

## The converts

[Andrej Karpathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrej_Karpathy), October 2025, on his nanochat project. He described it as "intellectually intense code" where "everything has to be very precisely arranged." AI was "net unhelpful." He called the output "slop."

[Andrej Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2004607146781278521), December 2025:

> "I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored."

Two months apart.

[DHH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson), summer 2025:

> "Not letting AI write any code directly."

[DHH](https://x.com/dhh), January 2026:

> "Half the resistance was simply that the models weren't good enough yet... That has now flipped. Working with opencode has been a blast. Watching the thinking models nail a difficult bug is a revelation."

## The skeptics

[George Hotz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hotz), June 2023:

> "GPT is great for quick generic scripts, but not for complex tasks."

He's noted that AI may help with "typing-speed-limited" work, but that's not where his bottleneck is. His work on [tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad) is low-level, performance-critical, novel.

[ThePrimeagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThePrimeagen), March 2025:

> AI "often gets it wrong, especially with larger, more complex codes... lacks deep understanding for problem-solving and design."

He sees some utility. Not transformative.

[John Blow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Blow), [January 2026](/2026/01/03/the-witnesses/):

> "Current AIs can't code. It's clear by now that everyone who thinks they can are not good programmers themselves, and/or only ever do trivial problems."

## The pattern

The converts are in web, enterprise, applications. The skeptics are in systems programming, game engines, low-level optimisation.

Both can be right. The experiences are genuinely different depending on what you build.

I look at scaling laws and feel fairly confident the tide will rise to cover every domain eventually. But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe some kinds of work are genuinely stubborn. Maybe the skeptics aren't waiting for the models to catch up - maybe they're seeing something real about the limits of this approach.

## The expanding universe

What's new isn't that one side is winning. It's that more ways of working are viable now than before.

A web developer shipping features with Claude Code and a game engine developer writing everything by hand are both being reasonable. A year ago, only one of those approaches existed. Now both do.

The conversation is fragmenting because the experiences are genuinely different. What feels obviously true in one domain can sound naive in another. The universe is expanding - not everyone moving in the same direction at different speeds, but different communities pulling further apart.

I wrote a few days ago about [crossing a threshold](/2026/01/02/crossing-the-horizon/). Some people have crossed it. Others haven't, and might never need to. Both can be right.
