The most eager people I knew were leaning into [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider) this time last year. It felt premature to me - jagged, tricky to use, more friction than flow.

Now everyone's on Claude Code.

Paul Gauthier, Aider's creator, was early. He set things up for everyone else. That's how these things go.

## The pattern

Agent orchestration is in that same early phase now. Steve Yegge just released [Gas Town](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04) - and even he includes this warning:

> Do not use Gas Town if you do not juggle at least five Claude Codes at once, daily. Do not use Gas Town if you care about money. Do not use Gas Town if you are more than 4 feet tall. I want to tower impressively at meet-ups, like Sauron. Do not use Gas Town.

(This is almost the most Yegge quote imaginable.)

Chris Laidler put it well: "I don't believe agents running agents is ready yet."

Chris is one of the best people I know at staying current with this stuff. If he thinks it's not ready, that's information about how far we have to go. The big wrapper companies - Cursor, Windsurf, the rest - have almost certainly been experimenting with orchestration longer than Yegge's pet project. Nothing shipped yet. That silence says something.

## But

This feels like March 2024 for agents - but one rung up. The timelines are accelerating, so I don't have a strong feeling about when the tipping point comes. I can just sense that smart people are starting to ask the natural next questions.

The [abstraction ladder](/2026/01/03/first-contact/) keeps extending. Each rung seems less than serious until suddenly it's ubiquitous.

## The timing problem

There's a more general lesson here about managing exploratory tool usage. Wait until things are mature and you'll be late. But you can also burn a lot of time and energy checking whether things are almost ready.

I don't have a good answer to this. But if you're a skunk works team within your organisation - or if you're trying to [be the inkblot yourself](/2026/01/03/first-contact/#inkblot-strategy) - it makes sense to be continually asking these questions. Somebody has to stay close enough to know when the tipping point arrives.
