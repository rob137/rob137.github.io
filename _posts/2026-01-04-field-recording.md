A follow-up to [Fresh and Stale](/2026/01/04/fresh-and-stale/).

James mentioned he uses Zoom recorders for capturing gigs. I went down a rabbit hole reading about field recording as a pursuit. It has a birdwatching quality to it.

Here's the pattern I noticed: every video about field recording has a detour about three quarters of the way in. The presenter compares the practice to meditation. Standing still. Listening. Noticing things you'd normally filter out.

The interesting part is how it's always presented. Not as common wisdom. As something they've realised themselves.

I don't know what to make of this. Maybe certain insights resist transmission. You can hear someone say "field recording is meditative" and nod along, but the understanding only lands when you've stood in a forest holding a microphone for twenty minutes.

Or maybe the framing matters. Presenting it as personal discovery makes it land differently than presenting it as received knowledge.

Either way, the pattern of independent rediscovery is worth noticing. Some things apparently need to be figured out fresh each time.
