excerpt: "Meeting in the middle might be the risky choice."

Spreadsheet people are the adults in the room. But it becomes a cargo cult if you're missing opportunity because of it.

Enthusiasts are possibly Toad of Toad Hall. But every so often they're right, and ignoring them gets you killed.

On an individual level, you have both. Spreadsheet demon on one shoulder, enthusiast on the other. The question is whether to meet in the middle.

I'm coming down on the side that being extreme is actually the most sensible path in many cases. The middle feels safe but might just mean you get the downsides of both - too slow to seize opportunity, too fast to avoid the traps.

You kind of do just know sometimes. The hard part is trusting it.
