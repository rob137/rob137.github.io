Token costs for the same level of performance have dropped something like 400x in the past eighteen months.

This doesn't matter.

In a workplace, if someone asks whether your AI workflow is expensive, you've already lost. You're in zugzwang - any move makes things worse.

## The Hydra Problem

You could explain that token costs have cratered. But now you're in a conversation about cost trends, and they'll find a new angle.

You could explain that the outer loop - shipping software faster - dwarfs the inner loop of daily token spend. But now you're defending your productivity, and that's a minefield.

You could explain that the business of software is about amortizing costs across iteration speed, opportunity cost, time-to-market. But now you sound like you're lecturing, and they'll push back harder.

Every response grows more heads.

## The Real Calculation

The question "isn't that expensive?" treats token spend as a cost centre to be minimised. But if you're on a team that's supposed to be [exploring](/2026/01/03/first-contact/#inkblot-strategy) what people will be doing soon, the calculation is different.

The cost of *not* finding the better workflow is invisible. The cost of tokens shows up on a dashboard.

Visible costs get scrutinised. Invisible costs don't. This is the root of the innovator's dilemma, playing out in miniature every time someone questions your tooling.

## The Correct Posture

The zugzwang only applies at the peer level - where dashboards dominate and debates grow heads.

The correct move is to reject the framing while taking the problem seriously. Costs matter - but *which* costs? Leadership has broader concerns. They're not tied to this week's token spend. They can see that iteration speed and capability discovery matter more than line-item costs.

This is [Seeing Like a State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State) in miniature. The dashboard makes certain costs legible and others invisible. Your job is to make the invisible costs visible to people who can act on them.

At the peer level: stay courteous, stay concrete, don't pick up the invitation to debate. The debate itself is the cost - time, energy, goodwill, all spent on the wrong problem. At the leadership level: make the case for what you're learning and why it matters.

The zugzwang is real. But you don't have to play on that board.
