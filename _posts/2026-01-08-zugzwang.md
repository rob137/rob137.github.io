Token costs for the same level of performance have dropped something like 400x in the past eighteen months.

This doesn't matter.

In a workplace, if someone asks whether your AI workflow is expensive, you've already lost. You're in zugzwang - any move makes things worse.

## The Hydra Problem

You could explain that token costs have cratered. But now you're in a conversation about cost trends, and they'll find a new angle.

You could explain that the outer loop - shipping software faster - dwarfs the inner loop of daily token spend. But now you're defending your productivity, and that's a minefield.

You could explain that the business of software is about amortizing costs across iteration speed, opportunity cost, time-to-market. But now you sound like you're lecturing, and they'll push back harder.

Every response grows more heads.

## The Real Calculation

The question "isn't that expensive?" treats token spend as a cost centre to be minimised. But if you're on a team that's supposed to be exploring what people will be doing soon, the calculation is different.

The cost of *not* finding the better workflow is invisible. The cost of tokens shows up on a dashboard.

Visible costs get scrutinised. Invisible costs don't. This is the root of the innovator's dilemma, playing out in miniature every time someone questions your tooling.

## The Correct Posture

I've come to think the correct posture is to avoid the conversation entirely. Stay courteous, stay concrete, don't pick up the invitation to debate.

If you're forced to respond, keep it minimal. Don't fan the flames. Don't offer conversational openings that can be misinterpreted.

It's a bit sad, because the natural thing is to share what you're learning. But some questions aren't really questions. They're positions looking for validation.

The zugzwang is real. Sometimes the only winning move is not to play.
