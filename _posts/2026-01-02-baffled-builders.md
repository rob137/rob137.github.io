excerpt: "A running list of respected programmers - people with Wikipedia pages for actually building things - expressing genuine surprise at AI coding tools."

I've started collecting quotes. Not from AI startup founders or people who've pivoted into the space. From builders - people known for shipping things, with track records that predate the current moment.

The pattern I'm looking for: genuine surprise. The moment when expectations collide with experience.

## The list

**[Jaana Dogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaana_Dogan)** - Senior Google engineer, known for her work on Go and distributed systems:

> "I'm not joking and this isn't funny. We have been trying to build distributed agent orchestrators at Google since last year. There are various options, not everyone is aligned... I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour."

**[Eric S. Raymond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond)** - Author of *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*, maintainer of fetchmail, gpsd, NTPsec:

> "My life has changed this week. There's finally an AI coding tool that's good enough to keep up with me... Going back to coding without AI would be plain stupid - it makes me much faster and delivers constant correctness checks."

**[Steve Yegge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Yegge)** - Amazon, Google, Sourcegraph. Famous for the [Platforms Rant](https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611):

> "We all knew this was coming, but nobody knew it would be here now."

---

**[Gene Kim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Kim_(author))** - Author of *The Phoenix Project* and *The DevOps Handbook*:

> He told Claude Code to run cURL itself. 45 seconds later, it said "I tried six different iterations and got it working." For Gene, that was "life changing."

## Why this matters

These aren't impressionable newcomers. They're people who've been sceptical of hype before - often correctly. When someone who wrote foundational texts on open source development says their workflow has permanently changed, it's worth paying attention.

I'm not trying to convince anyone. If you've tried these tools and found them lacking, fair enough. But if you haven't tried them - or tried them a year ago and wrote them off - the landscape has shifted.

## A note on sceptics

[John Blow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Blow) remains unconvinced. He's earned that scepticism through decades of building things that work. I respect the position.

This list will keep growing until his standards are met.
