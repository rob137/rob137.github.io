[John Blow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Blow) - creator of *Braid* and *The Witness* - [recently](https://x.com/Jonathan_Blow/status/2006479911750611333):

> "Current AIs can't code. It's clear by now that everyone who thinks they can are not good programmers themselves, and/or only ever do trivial problems."

He's earned that position through decades of building things that work. I respect it.

But I keep noticing something: builders I also respect - people known for shipping, with track records that predate the current moment - expressing genuine surprise. The moment when expectations collide with experience. I've been keeping track.

**[Jaana Dogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaana_Dogan)** - Senior Google engineer, known for her work on Go and distributed systems:

> "I'm not joking and this isn't funny. We have been trying to build distributed agent orchestrators at Google since last year. There are various options, not everyone is aligned... I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour."

**[Eric S. Raymond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond)** - Author of *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*, maintainer of fetchmail, gpsd, NTPsec:

> "My life has changed this week. There's finally an AI coding tool that's good enough to keep up with me... Going back to coding without AI would be plain stupid - it makes me much faster and delivers constant correctness checks."

**[Gene Kim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Kim_(author))** - Author of *The Phoenix Project* and *The DevOps Handbook*:

> When asked if it felt like writing 4,000 lines of code, Gene said he didn't even count until writing about it afterwards. "It just felt like I was building the capabilities I needed at a magical pace. And code flowed like water."

**[Andrej Karpathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrej_Karpathy)** - Built Tesla Autopilot, created [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) and Stanford's cs231n:

> "I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored... Clearly some powerful alien tool was handed around except it comes with no manual and everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession."

**[Demis Hassabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demis_Hassabis)** - Sole programmer on *Theme Park* (in assembly, at 17), founder of DeepMind, Nobel Prize winner:

**[Sergey Brin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin)** - Co-created Google and PageRank, came out of retirement to work on Gemini:

## Why this matters

These aren't impressionable newcomers. They're people who've been sceptical of hype before - often correctly. When someone who wrote foundational texts on open source development says their workflow has permanently changed, it's worth paying attention.

I'm not trying to convince anyone. If you've tried these tools and found them lacking, fair enough. But if you haven't tried them - or tried them a year ago and wrote them off - the landscape has shifted.

One more thing: Blow might have a point about problem classes. There's probably still a gap between what these tools can do with enterprise code, distributed systems, and web services versus highly optimised game engines or low-level systems programming. The witnesses above are mostly in the former camp.

But the economic utility of that camp is vast. If Blow is right that the models only help with "trivial" problems, and those problems happen to represent most of the software industry's output, then he and the witnesses might just be talking past each other.

This list will keep growing.
