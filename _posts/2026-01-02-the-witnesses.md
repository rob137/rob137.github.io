[John Blow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Blow) - creator of *Braid* and *The Witness* - [recently](https://x.com/Jonathan_Blow/status/2006479911750611333):

> "Current AIs can't code. It's clear by now that everyone who thinks they can are not good programmers themselves, and/or only ever do trivial problems."

He's earned that position through decades of building things that work. I respect it.

But I keep noticing something: builders I also respect - people known for shipping, with track records that predate the current moment - expressing genuine surprise. The moment when expectations collide with experience. I've been keeping track.

> "I'm not joking and this isn't funny. We have been trying to build distributed agent orchestrators at Google since last year. There are various options, not everyone is aligned... I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour."

> "My life has changed this week. There's finally an AI coding tool that's good enough to keep up with me... Going back to coding without AI would be plain stupid - it makes me much faster and delivers constant correctness checks."

## Why this matters

These aren't impressionable newcomers. They're people who've been sceptical of hype before - often correctly. When someone who wrote foundational texts on open source development says their workflow has permanently changed, it's worth paying attention.

I'm not trying to convince anyone. If you've tried these tools and found them lacking, fair enough. But if you haven't tried them - or tried them a year ago and wrote them off - the landscape has shifted.

This list will keep growing.
