I feel like I'm exiting hyperspace every time I need to communicate with a client or wait on a stakeholder to state the next requirement. It feels totally natural to say this is just the cost of doing business. Humans and human taste are what counts.

Except I actually disagree, because of factory-made sandwiches.

The economy is a force unto itself. It isn't designed to fit around humans. We've been contorting people to fit it for hundreds of years. And I think pretty soon AI will graft onto economic needs far better than people can. At which point the question becomes how to avoid including humans in loops entirely.

I've used this analogy in conversations at work, including on an internal corporate podcast. If you can do an 80% version at 1,000 times the efficiency, at some point it's obvious the 20% wasn't worth holding out for. There will still be niches. But they become rarefied categories. Hand woven baskets. Horse riding as recreation.

Some software that thinks it's a complex hand woven basket is actually just a plastic bag.

Here's an interesting thing about tailoring. At the very top end these days, you deliberately add imperfections to make it apparent the suit is handmade. And in Bangladesh where tailoring is cheap, off-the-shelf suits are higher status.

When you start to automate there's a dip in quality. Then it blasts up higher than the artisans could achieve in the first place.

The idea that output must conform to artisanal concerns is being given to us by the artisans. Who might get sidelined quite soon for economic reasons.
