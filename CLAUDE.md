# Blog - Claude Memory

## Voice
- Rob's posts are compressed from ~25 mins of talking/dictation
- Keep the spoken quality - don't over-polish
- No melodrama
- Avoid AI tells: "Not X because Y" + em dash, excessive hedging
- Push after every change - easier to review in browser

## Drafting workflow
1. Save raw transcript to `_notes/` first
2. Draft the post
3. **Before publishing: brutal self-edit pass**
   - What is the ONE core argument?
   - Cut anything that doesn't directly serve it
   - Interesting ≠ essential
   - Don't be polite about your own output
   - The raw transcript is preserved - nothing is truly lost
4. Generate image with gpt-image-1 (medium quality, no text/letters)
5. Backdate times to GMT if needed
6. Push

## Common issues
- Too many threads for word count (James Thompson feedback)
- Tailoring examples, Bangladesh suits etc = tangent, cut it
- Garden path sentences - use "when" as hinge to clarify

## Files
- `_notes/` - raw transcripts, fragments (gitignored)
- `_posts/` - published posts
- `backlog.md` - ideas tracker
- `assets/images/` - post images
